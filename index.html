            <p class="p-size"> I am a Full-stack Developer, Also I have rich experience in front-end frameworks such as react, angular and vue.The thing that React does really well is the second part of the definition: building User Interfaces. A User Interface is anything we put in front of users to have them interact with a machine. User Interfaces are everywhere, from the simple buttons on a microwave to the dashboard of a space shuttle. If the device weâ€™re trying to interface can understand JavaScript, we can use React to describe a User Interface for it.</p>
